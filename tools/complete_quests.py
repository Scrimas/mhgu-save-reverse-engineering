"""Mark every quest of an MHGU save as cleared. Dry run unless --write is given.

What a real clear leaves behind is written too (see ../docs/05-quests.md, "What all
quests completed takes"):

  1. cleared + seen bit of every real row of ../data/quest-index.csv
     (placeholder rows, unused event slots and the second occurrence of a repeated
     ID are skipped);
  2. for every villager request with a quest that is not accepted yet: its accepted
     flag and the other flags its offer block sets or clears (column `also` of
     ../data/request-offer.csv). The completed flag is NOT written: the NPC's report
     line stays available and hands over the reward in the game;
  3. the quest set bits at base+0x3187 of every set whose members are then all
     cleared. The Arena rank sets 46, 47, 53, 78, 79 need Arena records and are left.

Not touched: star levels and HR (reported if they are below the maximum), the failed
bitmap, Arena records, quest counters, the history log, awards, the pending set
notices at base+0x3197, and the story flags that talk lines set once their quests are
cleared (listed at the end of the run).

Usage:  complete_quests.py [--write] [--no-events] [--no-requests] system [system ...]
        With --write every given file is changed in place. Close the emulator and
        take a copy first; give both save slots (0/system and 1/system).
