# 07 — Equipment, transmog and dye

The equipment box, the equipped-gear cache, the saved equipment sets ("My Sets"), and
where transmog and armor pigment actually live. Everything here was confirmed by
writing bytes, loading the save in-game, and checking the result on screen.

Offsets in this document are **relative to the character base** (next section), not
absolute. The absolute values quoted are for the first character slot.

## Character slots

**DERIVED.** The file starts with a 36-byte (`0x24`) Switch header. The MHXX-layout
body follows it, and its own header carries a slot-use table and slot pointers:

| Absolute | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `0x28` | 3 × u8 | slot in use (1 / 0) for characters 1–3 |
| `0x2B` | u8 | last loaded slot |
| `0x34` | 3 × u32 | offset of character 1–3, **relative to `0x24`** |

```python
base = 0x24 + int.from_bytes(buf[0x34 + 4*slot : 0x38 + 4*slot], "little")
```

In the analysed save, slot 1 is `0x18CC78 + 0x24 = 0x18CC9C`. The unused slots still
have pointers (`0x2AC53C`, `0x3CBE00`), giving a stride of `0x11F8C4` bytes.
`base + 0x00` is the character name. This matches the MHXX `system` layout once the
`0x24` header is accounted for.

Every absolute offset in docs 02–05 falls inside slot 1's block. That makes it very
likely those structures are per-character too (for example, deviant permits are at
`base + 0x283C`). This has **not** been checked against a save with two characters.

## Equipment box

**CONFIRMED.** `base + 0x62EE` (absolute `0x192F8A`): 2000 entries × 36 bytes, in the
same order as the in-game box. An empty entry is all zero.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x00` | u16 | type (bits 0–4), level − 1 (bits 5–9), bits 10–15 see below |
| `+0x02` | u16 | equipment ID (armor: armor ID; weapon: index into the weapon-tree table) |
| `+0x04` | u16 | **transmog appearance ID** (armor only; 0 = own look) |
| `+0x06` | 3 × u16 | decoration item IDs, one per slot, 0 = empty |
| `+0x0C` | 24 | armor/weapon: zero in every entry observed; talisman: see below |

Type codes seen: 1 head, 2 chest, 3 arms, 4 waist, 5 legs, 6 talisman, 7–21 weapon
classes (18 = Dual Blades). The level field stores the in-game level minus one.
Writing max level produced the right raw and element values on the status screen.

**UNRESOLVED — bits 10–15 of `+0x00`.** The MHXX notes call this the "transmog
level". It was zero on every box entry, including transmogged ones. The equipped
cache copy of one transmogged helm had bit 15 set when its box source did not.
Leaving it at zero is safe: transmog works without it.

### Talisman fields

**CONFIRMED.**

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x0C` | u8 ×2 | skill-tree ID 1, 2 |
| `+0x0E` | i8 ×2 | skill points 1, 2 |
| `+0x10` | u8 | slot count |
| `+0x12` | u8 | tier code: 97 Mystery, 98 Shining, 99 Timeworn, 100 Enduring |
| `+0x13` | u8 | 1 on every talisman observed |

## Transmog

**CONFIRMED.** Transmog is per box entry: bytes `+0x04..+0x05` hold the armor ID whose
model is displayed. Writing an ID there changes the look of that piece in every set
that uses it. Skills, slots and defense are unchanged. The in-game "Col" column shows
the transmog marker for these pieces. The target must be the same body part and a
class the hunter can wear. No ownership check was triggered on load.

## Armor pigment (dye)

**Not stored per armor piece.** In every box entry of a save containing dyed,
transmogged gear, bytes `+0x0C..+0x23` were zero. Pigment belongs to the *outfit*:
one colour per body part, kept in two places.

### Current outfit

**DERIVED.**

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `base + 0x24C` | 5 × RGBA | pigment per body part |
| `base + 0x270` | u8 | bits 0–4: 1 = use the armor's default colour for that part, 0 = custom |

Changing sets rewrites these, so they are just a copy of the equipped set's values.
Default colours are written out explicitly (e.g. `fa f5 e6 ff`), not stored as zero.

### My Sets (saved equipment sets)

**CONFIRMED** for the box indices, name and pigment. Set 1 is at `base + 0x208C8`
(absolute `0x1AD564`), stride `0x88`. The menu shows 5 pages × 8 sets, so there are
most likely 40 records. That count is **DERIVED** from the UI.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x00` | 6 | UNRESOLVED (varies per set) |
| `+0x06` | 24 | set name, single-byte text, NUL-padded (`---` when unused) |
| `+0x30` | 7 × u16 | box index for weapon, head, chest, arms, waist, legs, talisman; `0xFFFF` = empty |
| `+0x3E` | 7 × 3 × u16 | copy of each piece's decorations (**DERIVED**) |
| `+0x6A` | 5 × RGBA | pigment per body part |
| `+0x7E` | 5 | zero |
| `+0x83` | 5 × u8 | per-part default flag: 1 = default colour, 0 = custom RGBA |

The five RGBA values are probably ordered chest, arms, waist, legs, head, as in the
MHXX Guild Card. That order is **DERIVED** only: every test used the same colour on
all five parts.

To dye a set, write the RGBA five times at `+0x6A` and clear the five flags at `+0x83`.
Confirmed in-game: a colour written this way appears on the hunter when the set is
loaded.

Alpha was `0xFF` in every colour the game wrote. A forum report says it controls the
specular "shine". That is untested here.

## Equipped-gear cache

**DERIVED.** `base + 0x110`: 7 × 44-byte records (weapon, head, chest, arms, waist,
legs, talisman). Each record starts with a copy of the 36-byte box entry. A u32 that
was constant across all seven slots (`14 a5 e3 01` in the analysed save) sits 4 bytes
before each copy; its meaning is UNRESOLVED. The game appears to rebuild this cache
from the box. If an editor changes a worn piece in the box, it should patch the
matching cache record the same way.

## Editing checklist

1. Resolve the character base through the pointer at `0x34`. Don't hard-code it.
2. Only write to empty box slots, or to entries you have just read and matched.
3. Transmog: write `+0x04`. Dye: write the My Set pigment (and the current-outfit
   pigment if that set is worn).
4. Write both commit slots identically, with the emulator closed (see
   [01 — Container](01-container.md)).
